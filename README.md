This is a program to test batch functions in Java programs. 

The program uses Maven as packaging software. 

There are 3 classes - Coach, Player and SoccerTeam. They are all in SoccerTeam.java file  

There are 15 junit test cases, all in SoccerTeamTests.java 

Since the batch programs use main class, we have included a dummy sequence in Main.java file.
